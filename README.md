# stack-lang-interpreter
A partial and minimal implementation of the basic logic of a stack machine, inspired by the one created by David Beazley [in this talk](https://youtube.com/watch?v=r-A78RgMhZU&feature=shares]).

This only implements the very basic functionality of it, including just the multiplication and addition commands, with support for only `Int` constants.
